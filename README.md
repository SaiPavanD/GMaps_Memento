The project is to figure out which city is being viewed in Google Maps based on the memory footprint.

* rand_cities.py is used to randomly pick a fixed no. of cities from a bigger list of cities.

* gen_data.py is used to generate the DRS data dump for given list of cities. No. of iterations per city should be mentioned.

* plotter.py generates the DRS vs time plots for the given data dump.

* merge_dumps.py is used to merge multiple dump files into one.

* data2csv.py generates the Azure ML studio readable csv files from the data dumps.

* utils.py has required utility functions.
